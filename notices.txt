1) I had a mistake: TokenMismatchException in VerifyCsrfToken.php line 68!
	Solution:
   a.  Remove everything from framework/session folder
   b. add <meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}"/> in a head (don't forget to use this small piece of shit '/>', it was the bigest hitch)

2) Find the way to make a referende to the 'fabric' file and read about that!
3) Read about API, patriculary about API in Laravel
4) Add wifi-name and wifi-password fields to the place tables
5) Add 'upload-file' field for food and drink menu to the places table
6) Make all referenses according to the model
7) Launch two last migrations
